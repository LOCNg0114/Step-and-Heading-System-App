This project will be made using react native, expo, along with a lot of other packages and technologies which will help us get this step and heading app up and running with high accuracy.

<br>

## âž• Features

Currently the project has the following features:
  * Calibrate the step length estimation variables
  * Calculate the step, as well as the position in 2-dimensional.
  * Display the trajectory of the user
  
### Advantages
  * Easy to implement
  * The measurements are quite accurate.
  * Can be combined with other systems.
  * Work with any orientation of smartphone
  * This system returns results nearly in real-time.
  
 ### Disadvantages
  * Cannot handle the case where the user changes the orientation of theirsmartphone when walking.
  * It is possible to trick the algorithm of step detection by standing still andaccelerating the accelerometer.
